The biggest adventure I’ve encountered is making a speech in public
It happened like this: One day, our school Held an English speech contest
,I'm a freshman at that time, I have participated in the activities more actively
I was very ambitious ,I was selected into the finals
,but , My English pronunciation is not good
,And there are hundreds of  audience,A dozen professor did the judges
, because of my poor pronunciation,Judges  made a special impatience
Seeing this scene ,i feel very unpleasant, feeling a bit of a crash,But I try to normal play, 
through to the end of the speech
Then, I finally made it. 
It was a great accomplishment for me. I felt i get growth.though this event
This proves my ability, courage, and i have faith in myself
Judges

How did you make it? How did you feel then? What do you learn from it?
